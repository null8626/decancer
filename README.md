# decancer
A Node.js module that removes common confusables from strings written in pure [Rust](https://rust-lang.org).

Pros:

- Extremely fast, no use of regex whatsoever!
- No dependencies.
- Simple to use, just one single function.
- Supports all the way to UTF-32 code-points. Like emojis, zalgos, etc.
- While this project may not be perfect, it should cover the vast majority of confusables.

Con:

- Remember that this project is not perfect, false-positives may happen.

__**As of version 1.3.0, This library supports 3,624 different code-points.**__

# installation
```bash
$ npm install decancer
```

# example
```js
const decancer = require('decancer');
const noCancer = decancer('vＥⓡ𝔂 𝔽𝕌Ňℕｙ ţ乇𝕏𝓣');

console.log(noCancer); // 'very funny text'
```
> **NOTE:** output will ALWAYS be in lowercase.

If you want to check if the decancered string contains a certain keyword, i recommend using this instead of using `.includes`, since mistranslations can happen (e.g mistaking the number 0 with the letter O)

```js
const decancer = require('decancer');
const noCancer = decancer(someString);

if (decancer.contains(noCancer, 'no-no-word')) {
  console.log('LANGUAGE!!!');
}
```

# contributions
All contributions are welcome. Feel free to fork the project at GitHub! &lt;3

If you want to add, remove, modify, or view the list of supported confusables, you can clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/null8626/decancer), and open the Node.js REPL:

```js
> const reader = await import("./contrib/index.mjs");
> const data = reader.default("./bin/confusables.bin");
```
