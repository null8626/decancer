A library that removes common unicode confusables/homoglyphs from strings.

- Its core is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and utilizes a form of [**Binary Search**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm) to ensure speed!
- By default, it's capable of filtering **221,529 (19.88%) different unicode codepoints** like:
  - All [whitespace characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character)
  - All [diacritics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic), this also eliminates all forms of [Zalgo text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zalgo_text)
  - Most [leetspeak characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet)
  - Most [homoglyphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoglyph)
  - Several emojis
- Unlike other packages, this package is **[unicode bidi-aware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_text)** where it also interprets right-to-left characters in the same way as it were to be rendered by an application!
- Its behavior is also highly customizable to your liking!

## Installation
In your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
decancer = "3.2.8"
```
## Examples
For more information, please read the [documentation](https://docs.rs/decancer).

```rust
let mut cured = decancer::cure!(r"vÔº•‚ì°ùîÇ ùîΩùïå≈á‚ÑïÔΩô ≈£‰πáùïèùì£ wWiIiIIttHh l133t5p3/-\|<").unwrap();

assert_eq!(cured, "very funny text with leetspeak");

// WARNING: it's NOT recommended to coerce this output to a Rust string
//          and process it manually from there, as decancer has its own
//          custom comparison measures, including leetspeak matching!
assert_ne!(cured.as_str(), "very funny text with leetspeak");

assert!(cured.contains("funny"));

cured.censor("funny", '*');
assert_eq!(cured, "very ***** text with leetspeak");

cured.censor_multiple(["very", "text"], '-');
assert_eq!(cured, "---- ***** ---- with leetspeak");
```
