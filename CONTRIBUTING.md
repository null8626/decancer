# Contributing guide

If you want to contribute to the source code, feel free to do so! ❤️<br>
Don't forget to state on what should be changed and their reason.

If you want to see/modify on the confusables supported and/or their respective translation(s), feel free to do so! Here are the ways on how to do them;

- **To convert the binary into a readable and modifiable JSON, do the following:**

```console
node scripts/decode.mjs core/bin/confusables.bin
```

And a file called `output.json` should be generated in the same directory.

- **And to validate, optimize, and convert the JSON back into a binary, do the following:**

```console
node scripts/encode.mjs path/to/file.json
```

And a file called `output.bin` should be generated in the same directory, and an optimized version of the JSON file should appear at `path/to/fileOptimized.json`.

> P.S: for further optimizations purposes, it's recommended to do a second run of the encoding process, e.g `node scripts/encode.mjs path/to/fileOptimized.json`

- **The structure of the JSON is as follows:**

The optional fields here are only optional when writing and encoding them back into a binary.

```ts
interface Confusable {
  codepoint: number
  translation: string
  rangeUntil?: number | null
  syncedTranslation?: boolean
}

interface JsonContents {
  confusables: Confusable[]
  similar: string[][]
}
```

- **Information regarding the `Confusable` structure:**

  - The `JsonContents#confusables` array **must NOT be empty.** _(duh)_
  - `Confusable#codepoint` is the Unicode codepoint of the desired confusable. It must be in the unicode range, and outside the ASCII range (`\x80` to `\u10FFFF`)
  - `Confusable#translation` is the translation string, it must NOT be empty.
  - `Confusable#rangeUntil` is an optional number that indicates where the range of this confusable should end. If it's `null`, then the confusable is not a range. For example: Say a confusable with the codepoints of `\xE0` to `\xE5` all translates to `a`, then the `codepoint` field would be `0x00EO` and the `rangeUntil` field would be `0x00E5`. **Please note that the range size MUST be around `1` to `127`.**
  - `Confusable#syncedTranslation` is a flag whether this range's translation would change accordingly with the codepoint index. For example: `\xE0` translates to `a`, `\xE1` translates to `b`, `\xE2` translates to `c`, and so on.

- **Information regarding the `JsonContents#similar` field:**

  - The `string[][]` two-dimensional array **must NOT be empty** and it's length **must NOT exceed `127`.**
  - The `string[]` arrays **must NOT be empty** and their lengths **must NOT exceed `255`.**
  - Each `string` **must ONLY be only one character in length.**
  - Each `string` **must ONLY be in the UTF-1 range. This means only characters `\x00` to `\xFF` are allowed.**
